## greedy-palettization

A fast and accurate algorithm for choosing a palette up to 256 colors for a truecolor image.

This algorithm chooses a palette of 256 colors for a truecolor image, allowing the image to be stored as a an index-color png, gif, an 8-bit indexed texture or other index-color uses. This algorithm tends to be both faster and more accurate than the traditional approaches (octree and axis splitting).
